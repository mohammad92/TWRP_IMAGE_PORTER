TWRP_THEME_PORTER
==================

Informal Update: I have been seeing on XDA and AF that I was mysteriously banished with no explanation. Seems my Port script has taken a big hit so I wanted to inform you all that I willingly chose to be less active on XDA and AF so that I may be with family more often than not. Thanks for understanding.

Please, should you have the time and decide to adjust the codes then I insist you send it my way for review and so I may even possibly merge to my repo. Thanks!

-- Happy Hunting!!
